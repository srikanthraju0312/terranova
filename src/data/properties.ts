Nysha’s Haven was built with premium care, using Burma Teak that withstands monsoons, hand-carved stonework, and a seven-tonne steel staircase engineered for both style and function.Nysha’s Haven also perfectly balances relaxation and activity: a luxury farmhouse with swimming pool facing the lake, a tennis court that converts for multiple sports, and spaces are designed for both lively gatherings and quiet family moments. Open layouts, natural materials, and thoughtful placement of rooms add a distinct character to the farmhouse.Through Nysha’s Haven, Terranova successfully shows that true luxury isn’t about display, it’s about comfort, balance, and spaces that feel just right.",

Here, every plot is more than just land; it’s a foundation for dreams that grow, families that flourish, and investments that stand the test of time. Planned with precision, the project features well-laid internal roads, natural water harvesting systems, and ample green cover that preserves the landscape’s native beauty. Each plot is surrounded by open views and refreshing quiet, giving future homeowners the comfort of space and the freedom to build as they please — from a cozy farmhouse to a weekend retreat or even a long-term investment. What sets Kalakal apart is the way Terranova approaches land — not as real estate, but as living terrain. The soil here is rich, the air is crisp, and the surroundings are vibrant with local flora. Power, water, and fencing facilities ensure peace of mind, while dedicated maintenance support makes ownership effortless. Just an hour from Hyderabad, Kalakal sits close enough to convenience yet far enough from the city’s noise.

Today, it stands as one of our proudest creations — a living example of how design can honor nature while redefining luxury. Spread across acres of rolling hills, the property houses ten private cottages, a glasshouse restaurant, a full-service wellness center, and a heated infinity pool that overlooks endless tea valleys. Each space is designed to frame Ooty’s raw beauty — from mist-covered decks to fire-lit lounges that open into the clouds. Every material used here — the stone, wood, even the light fixtures — was chosen to blend seamlessly with the surroundings. Guests wake up to the sound of birds, enjoy organic meals grown on the estate, and unwind with yoga, spa therapies, and long forest walks. This project was born from a simple idea: to create a place where time slows down, and people reconnect — with nature, and with themselves. What once were two silent mountains are now a living, breathing space for wellness, reflection, and wonder.",
